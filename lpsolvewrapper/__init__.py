  """LP_SOLVE  Solves mixed integer linear programming problems.

  SYNOPSIS: [obj,x,duals,stat] = lp_solve(f,a,b,e,vlb,vub,xint,scalemode,keep)

     solves the MILP problem

             max v = f'*x
               a*x <> b
                 vlb <= x <= vub
                 x(int) are integer

  ARGUMENTS: The first four arguments are required:

           f: n vector of coefficients for a linear objective function.
           a: m by n matrix representing linear constraints.
           b: m vector of right sides for the inequality constraints.
           e: m vector that determines the sense of the inequalities:
                     e(i) = -1  ==> Less Than
                     e(i) =  0  ==> Equals
                     e(i) =  1  ==> Greater Than
         vlb: n vector of lower bounds. If empty or omitted,
              then the lower bounds are set to zero.
         vub: n vector of upper bounds. May be omitted or empty.
        xint: vector of integer variables. May be omitted or empty.
   scalemode: scale flag. Off when 0 or omitted.
        keep: Flag for keeping the lp problem after it's been solved.
              If omitted, the lp will be deleted when solved.

  OUTPUT: A nonempty output is returned if a solution is found:

         obj: Optimal value of the objective function.
           x: Optimal value of the decision variables.
       duals: solution of the dual problem."""
